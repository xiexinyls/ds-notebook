    "# Relationship between Statistics and Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "*Statistics* is the study of collection, analysis, and organization of data (from Wikipidia). Usualy the subject of statistics is a population. When we want to describe the population, we need the *probability theory*. The subject of probability is sample space, random variable, events, and stochastic processes. Statistics needs the framework of probability theory to do the estiamtion.\n",

    "# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "The major job for this analysis is to estimate the distribution of a population, which involves the location, spread, and shape of the data's distribution. This is also known as **descriptive statistics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Population means a group of existing objects (finite) and potentially infinite number of objects which are generalized from experience or definition (rephrased from Wikipedia). A population is usually associated with a random variable, where the probability theory fits in. We may use a variable to represent the quantity of this population. And since this variable can take on many values and each value will have a probabiltiy associated with it. distribution is the same as random variable probability mass or probability density distribution (see probability material).\n",

    "## Population Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "If we know all the data of a **population**, we can calculate some of its statistics, which reflect its distribition, such as mean\n",
    "$$\\bar{x}=\\frac{x_1+x_2+\\cdots+x_n}{n}$$\n",
    ", median, and histogram. Standard deviation of a population is defined as\n",
    "$$SD=\\sqrt{\\frac{(x_1-\\bar{x})^2+(x_2-\\bar{x})^2+\\cdots+(x_n-\\bar{x})^2}{n}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, we only know a sample of the whole population data. However it would be good to estimate the statistics of the population by only doing some calculation with sample data. Suppose now we have $n$ samples of a population (more than $n$). We want to estiamte its mean \n",

    "# Inferential Statistical Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main branches for inferential statistics analysis: **explanatory modeling** and **predictive modeling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major job for explanatory modeling is to find the relationship between data. (from SAS material)\n",
    "\n",
    "* How is X related to Y?\n",
    "* Sample size are small.\n",
    "* Include few variables.\n",
    "* Use p-values and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major job for predictive modeling is to find the relationship between data. (from SAS material)\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you know X, can you predict Y?\n",
    "* Sample size are large.\n",
    "* Include many variables.\n",
    "* Need holdout verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanatory Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notations and Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, population parameters (or distribution population) are represented by Greek letters while sample statistics are represented by English letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent variables are also called input variable, control variable, explanatory variable, and predictor variable. Dependent variable is also called response variable, outcome variable, and target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative data are represented by numbers, which can be continuous or discrete. Arithmetic operations can be applied to quantitative data. Categorical data are represented by labels, which can be nominal (no ordering, classification) or ordinal (with ordering). It has no meaning to apply arithmetic operations to categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before You Do Analysis, check for outliers, data entry errors. Check range, frequency, shape of data, and uniqueness of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard error. Standard deviation of sample means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distribution of Sample Mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point Estimator and Interval Estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence Intervals. the true population mean is in the confidence level for a confidence level. (95%). mu+-t*se. t quantile level. how to make the confidence interval smaller? decrease t or increase sample size n becuase se=mu/sqrt(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis Test. null hypothesis: equality or some relationship. alternative hypothesis: inequality or no relationship. \n"
