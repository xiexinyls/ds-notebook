    "# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "The major job for this this analysis is to estimate the distribution of a popular, which involves the location, spread, and shape of the data's distribution. Also known as **descriptive statistics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inferential Statistical Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main branches for inferential statistics analysis: **explanatory modeling** and **predictive modeling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major job for explanatory modeling is to find the relationship between data. (from SAS material)\n",
    "\n",
    "* How is X related to Y?\n",
    "* Sample size are small.\n",
    "* Include few variables.\n",
    "* Use p-values and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major job for predictive modeling is to find the relationship between data. (from SAS material)\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you know X, can you predict Y?\n",
    "* Sample size are large.\n",
    "* Include many variables.\n",
    "* Need holdout verification.\n",

    "## Explanatory Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notations and Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, population parameters (or distribution population) are represented by Greek letters while sample statistics are represented by English letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent variables are also called input variable, control variable, explanatory variable, and predictor variable. Dependent variable is also called response variable, outcome variable, and target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative data are represented by numbers, which can be continuous or discrete. Arithmetic operations can be applied to quantitative data. Categorical data are represented by labels, which can be nominal (no ordering, classification) or ordinal (with ordering). It has no meaning to apply arithmetic operations to categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before You Do Analysis, check for outliers, data entry errors. Check range, frequency, shape of data, and uniqueness of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard error. Standard deviation of sample means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distribution of Sample Mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point Estimator and Interval Estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence Intervals. the true population mean is in the confidence level for a confidence level. (95%). mu+-t*se. t quantile level. how to make the confidence interval smaller? decrease t or increase sample size n becuase se=mu/sqrt(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis Test. null hypothesis: equality or some relationship. alternative hypothesis: inequality or no relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "For quantitative data, we can calculate basic statistics such as mean, median, mode, frequency distribution, percentile, range, coefficient variation to see what the data look like. SAS provides `means` procedure to get basics statistics. By default, it first classifies data into groups according to `class`, finds all the quantitative variables and calculates the mean, min, max, and standard deviation. `maxdec` is maximum decimal digit number. `fw` means width. `printalltypes` outputs the all type results even with `class` specified.\n",

    "\n",
    "### A Single `univariate` Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Histogram is another way to look at frequency distribution visually. SAS provides a simple `univariate` procedure to check all the aspects of basic statistics\n",
